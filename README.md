This code is the basic representation of the huffman coding algorithm
The program can take a paragraph into the input, and in the output the encoded values are printed as shown below:

input : aabracadabra

Output:

The frequency of a is:6
The frequency of b is:2
The frequency of c is:1
The frequency of d is:1
The frequency of r is:2

char:a -> 6
char:b -> 2
char:r -> 2
char:d -> 1
char:c -> 1
  a   | 0
  c   | 100
  d   | 101
  r   | 110
  b   | 111
