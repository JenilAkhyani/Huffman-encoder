This code is the basic representation of the huffman coding algorithm<br>
The program can take a paragraph into the input, and in the output the encoded values are printed as shown below:

input : aabracadabra

Output:

The frequency of a is:6<br>
The frequency of b is:2<br>
The frequency of c is:1<br>
The frequency of d is:1<br>
The frequency of r is:2<br>

char:a -> 6<br>
char:b -> 2<br>
char:r -> 2<br>
char:d -> 1<br>
char:c -> 1<br>
  a   | 0<br>
  c   | 100<br>
  d   | 101<br>
  r   | 110<br>
  b   | 111<br>
